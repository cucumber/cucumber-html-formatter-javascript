## Hacking

While hacking on this module you may want to try it out manually. To be able to
do this without getting errors, first run:

    make clean && make && make npm-link-shared

This is to avoid errors from React as described in [facebook/react#13991](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13991).

After you have done that you should be able to generate HTML reports - for example:

```
../../fake-cucumber/javascript/bin/fake-cucumber \
features/*.feature | \
./bin/cucumber-html-formatter.js > \
index.html
```
